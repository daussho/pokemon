My name is Deden, a professor in biology
People call me Kang Deden
And your name is?
Ah! Yes, I remember, you are
, I study and research mutated animals caused by radioactive
These animals not only change their body form, but also gained weird, mysterious supernatural powers!
They are monsters!! Their behaviors are also unknown to us
So it's really dangerous if we encounter them
We're lucky because the new technology enable us to catch these animals
We can catch them with pocket-sized hyperdimensional ball, hence we call these animals Pokemon
Help me catch these pokemons so I can research them!
If we know their behavior, if we can tame them, we can make Indonesia a safer place to live!
A pokemon can be tamed if you catch them
So, we gotta catch as many pokemons as we can!
But I can't, I'm too old
A younger person like you would be able to do so
I need your help!
I have 3 tamed Pokemon here, choose one to accompany you!
